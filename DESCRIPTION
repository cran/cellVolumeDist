Description: Implements a methodology for using cell volume
        distributions to estimate cell growth rates and division times
        that is described in the paper, "Cell Volume Distributions
        Reveal Cell Growth Rates and Division Times", by Michael
        Halter, John T. Elliott, Joseph B. Hubbard, Alessandro Tona
        and Anne L. Plant, which appeared in the Journal of Theoretical
        Biology. In order to reproduce the analysis used to obtain
        Table 1 in the paper, execute the command
        "example(fitVolDist)".
